    <h2>Oak Tree</h2>

    <h3>Species</h3>
    <p>
      The oak tree belongs to the genus <em>Quercus</em>, which includes
      hundreds of species found across Europe, Asia, and North America.
    </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Oak trees are known for their strength, longevity, and ecological
      importance. Some oak species can live for several hundred years,
      making them a powerful symbol of time and resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oaks support a wide range of wildlife, providing food and shelter
      for insects, birds, and mammals. Their slow and steady growth
      makes them ideal subjects for long-term growth simulations.
    </p>

      In the next step, this tree will be visualized through a time-based
      simulation showing its growth from seed to maturity.
